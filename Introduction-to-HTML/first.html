            <p>Artificial Intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is a branch of computer science that deals with the
                creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such
                as understanding natural language, recognizing objects, solving problems, and even making decisions. AI
                involves developing algorithms and computer programs that enable machines to learn from data and
                experience, adapt to new situations, and perform tasks that are not explicitly programmed.</p>

            <h2>AI technologies can be broadly classified into three categories:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Supervised Learning: Here, the machine is trained on labeled data where both input and output are
                    known. The algorithm learns to make predictions based on the input data and the corresponding
                    labeled output.</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning: Here, the machine is trained on unlabeled data where only the input data is
                    known. The algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data and group them together.</li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning: Here, the machine learns through a system of rewards and punishments based
                    on its actions. It tries to maximize the rewards it receives by taking actions that lead to positive
                    outcomes and avoiding those that lead to negative ones.</li>
